to run, first ensure node js is installed, then navigate to the projects root folder
next run the command "npm install", in the directory terminal so that it will download all the dependencies
to view the GUI run "npm run dev" it will host the GUI at http://localhost:3000 on browser

you can find the page by clicking on the login buttons or directly navigating to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

Some notes:
There were some network or nodejs issues, i was unable to download the dependency for redux, as such i have commented out the codes using the redux. 
as a workaround I am using the browsers session storage to store persistent data for viewing

In case there are git issues, use the provided zip file, to use simply unzip the file, 
navigate to the project folder, and run the "npm run dev" command in the terminal from that directory

P.S in case there are issues with running and downloading node_modules, i will be providing the entire project as a zip at this link
