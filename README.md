to run, first ensure node js is installed
next run the command "npm install" so that it will download all the dependencies
to view the GUI run "npm run dev" it will host the GUI at http://localhost:3000 on browser

you can find the page by clicking on the login buttons or directly navigating to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

Some notes:
There were some network or nodejs issues, i was unable to download the dependency for redux, as such i have commented out the codes using the redux. 
as a workaround I am using the browsers session storage to store persistent data for viewing

P.S in case there are issues with running and downloading node_modules, i will be providing the entire project as a zip
